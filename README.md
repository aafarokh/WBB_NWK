This repository contains Matlab script codes to clean up and categorize the data set on Newronika WebBioBank. The codes can be used to clean and group any kind of biological and brain recording data bank, where big amount of data is stored and their manual selection and edit would be cumbersome. 

The matlab codes are applied on part of the WebBioBank (WBB) developed by Newronika S.p.A. This data set contains local field potential (LFP), Electroencephalographical (EEG), Electromyographical (EMG) and other types of recordings from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) gathered over years from both male and female genders and different range of ages. The pateints were undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation surgery, by which the LFPs where recorded in different settings such as off/on DBS, off/on medication, rest/move etc. 

A unique pateint ID (PID_xxxx) is given to each patient name. Each signal is labeled by a signal ID (SID) that is unique. At the end, each file is named by PIDxxxx
The information of each recording is gathered in a metadata file as a sheet, such as in Microsoft Office Excel format.
